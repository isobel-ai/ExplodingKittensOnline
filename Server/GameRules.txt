In the deck of cards are some Exploding Kittens. You play the game by putting the deck face down and 
taking turns drawing cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten.

When that happens, that person explodes (unless they have a Defuse card). They are now dead and out 
of the game.

This process continues until there's only 1 player left, who wins the game.

On your turn:
1. Pass or play as many cards as you want.

2. End your turn by drawing a card from the top of the draw pile into your hand. If you draw an
Exploding Kitten, play a Defuse card and reinsert the Kitten back into the draw pile anywhere you'd 
like in secret. If you don't have a Defuse card, you are out.  

3. Play then continues clockwise around the screen.

Field Guide:
-Exploding Kittens (x4): Unless you have a Defuse Card, you're dead.

-Defuse (x6): If you drew an Exploding Kitten, you can play this card instead of dying then reinsert 
the Kitten back into the draw pile anywhere.

-Nope (x5): Stop any action except for an Exploding Kitten or a Defuse Card. This can be played by the 
player whose turn is next (or the player who's being acted against in the case of a Favour card or pair 
of Cat Cards).


-Attack (x4): End your turn without drawing a card then force the next player to take two turns.

-Skip (x4): End your turn without drawing a card.

-Favour (x4): Force another player to give you 1 card from their hand. They choose which card to give 
you.

-Shuffle (x4): Shuffle the draw pile without viewing the cards.

-See the Future (x5): Privately view the top 3 cards from the draw pile and put them back in the same 
order.

-Cat Cards (x4 of each type): Powerless on their own, but a matching pair of them can be played to steal 
a random card from the other player.
